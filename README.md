## About
This is my place to gather and organize information about Automated Frequency Coordination implementations by various Wireless Networking vendors.

Pull requests are welcome, but any information that you wish to add needs to be well documented using publicly available information, or in other words [[Citation Needed]]. If I know you and you have information to contribute without public documentation, please reach out via social media or any method you prefer.

The formatting of this repo will likely change as I have time to orginize it better, so I'd recommend you link only to the main URL.

## Table

For now, here is a table that I've been working on. All of the info below is either publicly sourced or is information that I've verified.
